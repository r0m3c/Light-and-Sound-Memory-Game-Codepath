## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Added images to the screen.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
Well, for starters this was my first time using javascript, HTML, or CSS. The only languages I've used before have been Python, C++, and swift. So, this project was a bit challenging, with learning a new language and everything, but I think it was very rewarding. I'll begin with the challenging part. Firstly, I took some time reading each step because I saw this as the opportunity to learn a new programming language, especially those used by many. Although the steps were very specific I still had to watch some youtube videos to be able to fully understand the fundamentals. To be more specific, I had the most trouble with understanding the start and stop functions. I didn't understand the structures of it at all. I've done functions plenty of times before but for example, I didn't know what document.getElementByID was doing exactly. Thankfully, Codepath provided answers to my doubts and questions, yet I still had to research the term a bit more. Secondly, what also seemed to take me the most time was the "Adding sound to the game buttons" step. I managed to understand the large chunk of coding at a slow pace, but after I implemented it into my project, the sounds weren’t coming on when I was pressing the buttons. I went over the code about 20 times and I even restarted the entire project from scratch because I thought I had made a few silly mistakes. After restarting and getting back to this step, the sound still wasn’t working. I tried seeing if google had any answers. They didn’t. I was frustrated at this point as I’ve been at this step for almost 2.5 hours and I had run out of options. Finally, I tried opening Glitch in my Chrome browser to see if that would change anything. Thankfully, this managed to play the sounds as it should when any color button is pressed. I don’t know if it was Safari, but Chrome definitely managed to get the job done. This allowed me to complete the remaining of the project with the addition of some optional steps. To sum up, I faced the challenges of learning new languages for the first time and a browser issue, but this had been an incredible experience. I am proud that my project came to fruition and thankful that Codepath pushed me to learn new languages.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
After completing my submission what was mainly always in my mind was, who is our target audience? I know this was a project but is that something that one should always have on their mind before developing a website? Moreover, since this was my first time using these languages I was fascinated by what can be done with them. I realized some key similarities between C++, python, and Javascript. I thought that was interesting. Moreover, as I went through each step I kept thinking, "wow, I've seen some of these steps in websites and games I've played online." But the question that I had was where does the back-end development come in? I know the front-end takes care of layout, design, and interactivity, but for our game, could we have implemented the back-end here? Lastly, what do you think is the best way to begin developing websites? I do think I have a pretty good idea, but I would like to learn more.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had more time to work on this project, I would have done the rest of the optional features. I really did try for a while trying to implement images into the buttons. I had the idea of putting images of paintings that I love in each button, but the most I could do was implement two images. I had this whole vision but I just couldn't get it to work. I feel like I've given up, but I know this isn't the last time I will be working with these languages. I want to master them. I also wanted to add the ticking clock because I thought that would be awesome, but I couldn't get it to work. I tried implementing a function that would clear the timer once the user presses the correct pattern and so on. I definitely need more experience with these languages. To answer the question, I would spend plenty of more time mastering javascript, HTML, and CSS to not only complete the optional features I have stated but to have the experience for when I would need it in the future.
